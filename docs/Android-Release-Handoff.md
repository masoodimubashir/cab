The earlier handoff and `Google-Play-Release-Setup.md` referenced by AGENTS.md
were absent from this checkout; historical release details were not reconstructed.

- Driver app selected based on the preceding driver UI discussion.

### Local evidence

  `assembleRelease` completed successfully using the existing signing configuration.
